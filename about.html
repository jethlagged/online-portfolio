				<h4>Hi, I'm Jeth. How you doin'?</h4>
				<p>
					If we were doing introductions IRL it would probably go something like this:
					<br><br>
					Me: Hi, I’m Jeth.<br>
					You: Hi! Sorry, I didn’t quite catch that. What did you say your name was again?<br>
					Me: Jeth. You know... like a plane, with an “h”.<br>
					You: Oh, that’s an interesting name.<br>
					Me: Yeah, my mom didn’t think things through.
					<br><br>
					I studied digital filmmaking during my undergrad studies at De La Salle-
					College of Saint Benilde in Manila, Philippines, where I was introduced to the other implementations of art through my involvement with a design organization. Soon after, I realized that user experience design was something I wanted to pursue as I can not only do work that I enjoy, but also help make the world a better place.
					<br><br>
					I started my UI/UX design journey in 2017, when I started working for Kirigami on their web and mobile applications, surrounded by talented and supportive people. Currently, I am looking for more ways to challenge my capabilities (like coding this website!).
					<br><br>
					When I'm not doing design stuff, I spend my time reading graphic novels, editing photos and videos, singing pop songs in a tiny voice, and thinking about my next meal.
